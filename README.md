# Procedural Park

Written in Python (occasionally using MEL here and there). The idea is to generate a park based on a set of rules. I model procedural generation as a convex optimization problem. Minimizing my loss function is done through Monte-Carlo sampling

# How to use
Place everything into your `.../Documents/maya/2016/scripts` folder and open up `main.py` in the Script Editor window.
